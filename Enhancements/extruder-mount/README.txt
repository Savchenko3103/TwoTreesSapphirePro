# Summary

i made a few small upgrades for my TT Sapphire printer. 

There is an endstop mount for the X endstop switch. you might need some shorter than stock m2 screws to mount the endstop to the part.

There is a modified stepper motor mount for the X and Y motors, with this mount you can get rid of the 8mm steel rods, thus eliminating a lot of rotating mass, to reduce the ringing effect on the prints. since the stock pulleys fit for the 8mm rods, you will need an adapter for the 5mm shaft of the stepper. so i quickly designed an adapter. easy to print, it's a bit tight on the shaft, but you don't have to get new pulleys... no additional hardware needed, only the stock screws.

and for last, there is a modified extruder mount. it is designed to relocate the extruder thus reducing the length of the ptfe tube. it is made from 2 parts, because it has to be mounted to the 6mm top plate. you will need 2 M3 12-14mm screw and one M3 8mm. with this mount my printer runs perfectly with only 40 cm of capricorn tube. you have to align it around the middle if the bed, so a shorter ptfe tube is able to reach the whole bed. It is compatible with the stock Titan style extruder as well as a BMG style extruder.

If you have any question, feel free to ask.
i'm planning to design a new lcd mount, and a new hotend carriage in the near future... 

# Print Settings

Printer: TwoTrees Sapphire S
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2-0.3mm
Infill: 20%
Filament_brand: Prusament
Filament_color: Azure Blue
Filament_material: PLA

Notes: 
the bigger parts are printed at 0.3mm layer with 2 perimeters, some infill and 5 top and bottom solid layers. The small ones printed at 0.2mm layer height, the rest of the settings are the same.

you can print the parts with pla, they won't melt from the heat of the steppers, as they should not heat up that much. if they do, you have to adjust the vref, or look for binding in the movement system.
